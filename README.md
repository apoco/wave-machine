Creating music the hard way.

This code is a companion to my blog, [Music the Hard Way](http://musicthehardway.blogger.com). Each article that contains code references a particular branch in this repository.

* [My First Sine Wave](http://musicthehardway.blogger.com/) - [article-1](https://github.com/apoco/wave-machine/tree/article-1)

To build, you must have `ghc` installed and an `sh`-compatible shell. Run `build.sh`, and it should generate a `wave-machine` executable.
