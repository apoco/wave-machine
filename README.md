wave-machine
============

Creating music the hard way.

This code is a companion to my blog, [Music the Hard Way](http://apoco.github.io/wave-machine/). Each article that contains code references a particular branch in this repository.

To build, you must have `ghc` installed and an `sh`-compatible shell. Run `build.sh`, and it should generate a `wave-machine` executable.
