I'm an amateur musician (very amateur) and a professional programmer. Music fascinates me in many of the same ways as programming. I'm interested in the mathematical rules and relationships that govern tones, chords, and harmony. I'm also enamored with the possibility of procedural music generation.

Although I know some music theory, I know very little about sound itself and how it relates to music. My goal with this blog is to share what I learn and the code I write to explore sound generation. This also gives me a chance to become more experienced with the Haskell programming language.

Wish me luck as I learn how to create music the hard way.
